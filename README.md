# DC-BLDC-motor-torque-solver

you will need to adjust this code for your purposes

###

the 6-magnet-on-rotor quadrupole bldc motor torque is simulated here.

magpylib, numpy, so on.

adjust it for your purposes if you want.

real rotor is suspected to be made of neodymium magnets in 6-row halbach array (4pole), surrounded with iron/steel dust and cyanoacrylic glue.

coils are suspected to be made in the same way
